- For our beta testing, we got Dylan from Wilderman P4 (English Art 30 B) and Matthew Ms.Geida P2 (commercial cooking 30)


* Things they said that could be changed or might be cool to have were:
- Day and night cycle depending for aesthetic.
- trail of smoke to give the feeling of the original game.




* We didn't have much time for our beta testing because there were still a couple of bugs and we were still in the process of debugging everything. we spent about 10 minutes roughly for each person and going over all the logic that was implemented on our codes.




- As a suggestion if we had time. They said for more aesthetic maybe a different bird could be added. (we didn't have enough time for that so we couldn't really try that)
