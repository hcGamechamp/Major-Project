- The hardest thing that I faced on this project was combining matter.js and  p5.play (box.2d) liabrary. It was kind off a struggle at the start when I went into combining gravity and collision physics with mass and world engines. At first it would not work. There was nothing to go on from and for a solid two and a half weeks i did not know what i was doing.

- The hardest thing that I did was sync all the files toghether for both visual and game settings toghether.




* If we were to work on this again, we would definetly decide on a wider time scale than when we did. We would also try to work on more evenly then we did on this. It kinda got frustrating to do after the first 2 weeks when we did not know what we were doing and the liabraries werent making sense to us.




- We got through almost all of our needs to have list and added some new nice to have stuff. We swapped most of our list on what we wanted to have. The things we could've done better would have been splitting the work more evenly.
